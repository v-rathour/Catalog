# Shamir's Secret Sharing (Lagrange Interpolation) in Node.js

This project implements a simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm using Lagrange interpolation. The task is to find the constant term (secret) of a polynomial given a set of points derived from a JSON file. 

## Features
- Converts input values from different bases to decimal.
- Handles large integers using JavaScript's `BigInt`.
- Performs Lagrange interpolation to compute the secret constant term of the polynomial.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Place your input data in a file named `input.json`.

### Sample `input.json`
```json
{
    "keys": {
        "n": 4,
        "k": 3
    },
    "1": {
        "base": "10",
        "value": "4"
    },
    "2": {
        "base": "2",
        "value": "111"
    },
    "3": {
        "base": "10",
        "value": "12"
    },
    "6": {
        "base": "4",
        "value": "213"
    }
}
```

## Usage
1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the following command to execute the program:
   ```bash
   node shamirSecret.js
   ```

The program will read the input data from `input.json`, compute the secret constant term of the polynomial, and print it to the console.

### Example Output
```
The constant term (secret) is: 42
```

## How It Works
- The program reads the input from `input.json`.
- It extracts the number of points (`n`) and the required minimum points (`k`).
- Each point's value is converted from its given base to decimal using `BigInt`.
- Using Lagrange interpolation, the program computes the constant term (secret) of the polynomial, which is then printed to the console.
